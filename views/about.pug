        .about-bio

          p I began studying software development in 2023 to change careers from nursing. I have 9 years of critical-care nursing experience - most of which is in adult Medical and Cardiovascular ICUs. I am transitioning my critical-thinking and problem-solving skills into software development/engineering to create innovate solutions that boost productivity and improve accessibility. I work well in multi-disciplinary teams and have exceptional communication skills to facilitate team progress. I am always looking for change and enjoy challening myself to new experiences and skillsets. On my free time, I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai, and enjoy honing my firearm skills and safety at the gun range.
